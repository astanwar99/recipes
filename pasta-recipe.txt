Ingredients
1 x royal pasta dough
Tipo 00 flour , for dusting
2 cloves of garlic
3 fresh porcini mushrooms , (200g in total)
1 whole Umbrian truffle , (15g)
extra virgin olive oil
2 sprigs of fresh thyme
2 anchovy fillets in oil , from sustainable sources
20 g unsalted butter
20 g Grana Padano cheese

Method:
Make the royal pasta dough, saving half for another day.
Once rested, simply tear off 1cm balls of pasta dough and roll them out into 30cm 
very thin sausage shapes on a clean surface (this pasta shape is called pici), then 
place on a floured tray.
Put a large pan of salted water on to boil, ready for the pasta. Once boiling, peel 
and add the whole garlic cloves, scooping them out after 2 minutes (this will make 
the garlic creamy), then finely chop.
Quarter the porcini mushrooms, then halve and finely slice the truffle.
Drizzle 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil into a cold pan, place over a medium 
heat, then add the garlic, strip in the thyme and scatter in the truffle and porcini. 
Toss occasionally over the heat while you cook the pasta.
Carefully add the pasta to the boiling water, then cook for 4½ minutes (if you’ve left 
the pasta to dry out, it will take a little longer).
Add the anchovies to the porcini pan (they will just melt), toss together, then add a 
little pasta water to emulsify into a lovely mushroom sauce. Remove from the heat, then 
stir in the butter.
Using tongs, drag the pasta into the porcini pan taking a little cooking water along with 
it. Toss together, then finely grate in the cheese, and toss again.
Season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper, then finish with a drizzle of extra 
virgin olive oil.
